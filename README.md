# OpenGL `.ply` viewer
**Repository created for archiving purposes, and thus unmaintained.**

Very simple OpenGL college project to view `.ply` files.

Example models are included (some animated).

Keybinds:
- 1-7: Change model (6 requires you to load a `.ply` file).
- P: Toggle vertex display.
- L: Toggle edge display.
- F: Toggle fill display.
- C: Toggle checkered display.
- Arrows: Move view.
- Page up / Page down: Zoom view.

Created using [QT Creator](https://www.qt.io/product/development-tools), which is also needed to build.
